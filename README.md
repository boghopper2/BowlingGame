Rules 
When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically 
rendered as an “X” on a score sheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is 
scored with the next two balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are 
counted twice.
Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins
Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins
The total score from these throws is:
Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19
Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9
TOTAL = 28
A player who scores multiple strikes in succession would score like so:
Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 3, ball 1: 4 pins
Frame 3, ball 2: 2 pins
The score from these throws are:
Frame one: 10 + (10 + 4) = 24
Frame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16
Frame three: 4 + 2 = 6
TOTAL = 46
The most points that can be scored in a single frame are 30 points (10 for the original strike, plus 
strikes in the two subsequent frames).
A player who bowls a strike in the tenth (final) frame is awarded two extra balls allowing the 
playing to gain bonus points. If both these balls also result in strikes, a total of 30 points (10 + 10 
+ 10) is awarded for the frame. These bonus points do not count on their own; they only count as 
the bonus for the strike.
